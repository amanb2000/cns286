Probability distributions quantify the likelihood of events. 
Modern language models are chiefly concerned with approximating the probability distribution of sequences of well-formed text. 
Once a high-quality approximation of the probability distribution of text sequences is learned, text can be generated by sampling the distribution. 
A basic understanding of probability distributions ([Section 1.1](#probability-distributions)) is key to working with large language models. 
We will then provide an overview of basic methods (ML, MAP) for estimating probability distributions in [Section 1.2](#maximum-likelihood-estimation).
