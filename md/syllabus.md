## Lectures + Slides

 1. **Mathematics of Prediction**: [Chapter 1 Notes](https://lancelot.languagegame.io/cns286/ch01_math_of_prediction.html)
 	 - Review: Probability distributions, conditional distributions and likelihood. 
	 - Shannon N-gram models. 
	 - Parameter estimation (ML, MAP), statistical inference.
	 - Chain rule of probability for sequential prediction, log-likelihood loss function.
	 - _Bonus: Markov models, hidden Markov models_
 2. **Computational Predictive Models and Learning**:
 	 - Parameter estimation $\sim$ optimization $\sim$ learning $\sim$ function approximation. 
	 - Linear regression as a model learning system. 
	 - Loss functions, gradient descent. 
	 - Neural networks and the chain rule of calculus (backpropagation).
	 - The miracle of deep learning and the bitter lesson. 
 3. **Sequence Prediction with Recurrent Neural Networks**: 
 	 - Markov processes as canonical sequential statistical processes. 
 	 - Challenge of sequential prediction with neural networks. 
	 - Latent states for sequence prediction. 
	 - Backpropagation through time. 
	 - Problems with backpropagation through time. 
 4. **Attention is all you need**: 
 	 - Self-attention for sequence modelling. 
	 - Transformer blocks as multi-head self-attention + nonlinearities. 
	 - Masked language modelling with transformers (BERT).
	 - Causal auto-regressive language modelling with transformers (GPT).
